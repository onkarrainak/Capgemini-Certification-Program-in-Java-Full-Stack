    <h1>The Effects of Climate Change</h1>
    <p>
        Climate change has profound impacts on the environment and human life. It leads to rising sea levels,
        more extreme weather events, loss of biodiversity, and disruption of ecosystems. Additionally, it poses
        significant risks to agriculture, water supplies, and human health, increasing the frequency of heatwaves,
        droughts, and flooding. Addressing climate change requires global cooperation and immediate action to reduce
        greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable practices.
